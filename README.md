# Airplane Seating Assignment

## The Task
Design and implement a C# desktop application (not a client-server or database application) that
assigns seats on an airplane. Assume the airplane has 20 seats in first class (5 rows of 4 seats each,
separated by an aisle), and 180 seats in economy class (30 rows of 6 seats each, separated by an
aisle).

The application should provide the following functionality:
1. Assign seat(s) to passenger(s). When assigning seats, ask for the class (first or economy),
and the number of passengers travelling together (1 or 2 in first class, 1 to 3 in economy).
Then try to find match and assign the seats. If no match exists, display a message.
2. Display seating status (assigned & available) on the computer screen, allowing the user to
select from at least two different sorting orders, e.g. by seat numbers or by passenger names.
3. Save and retrieve the airplane’s seating state between program runs.

4. Quit the application.
Passenger’s details are not required to be maintained by the system; however, you may add extra
features - both data and functionality to the application, if you wish.

** Provide either console-based or window-based user interface for your application
